# Void-Encryption-Engine
88-character cryptographic engine. Uses rotary technique and advanced, constantly mutating alphabet map. Theoretical keyspace 88! (1.85*10^134). Entropy ranging 6.3 - 6.4 bits. Year 9 independent project by 12-year-old.
The Void is designed to withstand Grover-protocol attacks. Due to the 88! state-space and non-linear seed propagation, the engine remains mathematically intractable even for fault-tolerant Quantum hardware.

**CHALLENGE**
Below is a ciphertext encrypted in Void using a **random 256-bit key.**
If you can break it, you have found a way to break the Void's code.
If you succeed or fail in breaking Void, please submit you attempt, method and results in the Issues tab.

**THE CIPHERTEXT:**
G^w6[6?kV-mURfV)]YNz0hzaIx&A*S]e%d(\sPTNO@8j^$cCG8

Try any means to break it. The code is at your disposal. Report all attempts in the Issues tab. If you break this code, you have broken a code that the most advanced supercomputers theoretically could not crack before the sun flames out.
If you fail, you are no worse than a quantum supercomputer, so no worries.
Good luck.
